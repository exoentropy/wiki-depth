wiki-depth
==========

A multithreaded Python script that finds the minimum number of links between two Wikipedia articles. It's powered by
 <a href = "https://github.com/goldsmith/Wikipedia">Goldsmith's Python-wrapped Wikipedia API</a> and written using Python 2.7. 
 I wanted to experiment with the Wikipedia API in a meaningful way, however this is a quick project that I don't have any 
 intention of expanding or maintaining.
 
To run the scripts, simply clone the repo and use the following command:
<code>python WikiDepth.py < inputFile.in > outputFile.out</code>
